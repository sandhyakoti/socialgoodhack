#How to prevent accident deaths

#Analysis
A considerable percentage of the accidents are caused due to road conditions or bad roads.

Potholes, tar overbanding, obscured road signs, worn surfaces and diesel spills can all contribute to accidents for even the most careful driver.

#A Common Man's Perspective
Several times one or the other person has noticed that a bad condition of the road may lead to accidents and is willing to report only if a feasible/easy way is there.
There are several people who notice such things but are unable to report due to the complexity in the current reporting mechanisms.

#Proposed Solution
A smartphone application that monitors users travel routes through GPS and provides a very user friendly and easy way to report bad road conditions in those roads.

Refer ppt for design considerationa and the applications.
